primitiv documentation
======================

`primitiv <https://github.com/primitiv/primitiv>`_
is a neural network library developed by
`National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) <https://www.nict.go.jp/en/index.html>`_
and
`Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) <http://www.naist.jp/en/>`_.
primitiv is written by C++11 and supports some other languageso such as Python
and Rust through bindings. primitiv allows users to write their own networks
using a *define-by-run* style writing and mostly device-independent criteria,
and performs them using various computing backends such as Eigen, CUDA and
OpenCL.
